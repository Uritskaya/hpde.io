        "Description": "IRI-based Real-Time Assimilative Model (IRTAM)\n\t is a collection of global 3D ionospheric electron density\n\t (Ne) computations produced every 15 minutes to follow the\n\t timeline of the ionospheric weather dynamics. IRTAM 3D\n\t belongs to a class of \"assimilative IRI\" models\n\t that replace the internal coefficients of International\n\t Reference Ionosphere (IRI), an empirical quiet-time model of\n\t ionospheric climate with updated coefficients that are\n\t obtained by smoothly transforming (\"morphing\") IRI\n\t into agreement with available observations. The observations\n\t are provided in near-real-time by Global Ionosphere Radio\n\t Observatory (GIRO) ionosondes. IRTAM 3D is a 4DVAR\n\t assimilative model whose single computation provides the best\n\t fit of the model to 24-hour history window of observations\n\t prior to analysis time. Its underlying formalism of\n\t representing Ne distributions is the same as in IRI: a set of\n\t 2D surface maps are computed to obtain the \"anchor\"\n\t points of the 1D vertical extent of Ne at any location and\n\t time.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Heavy investments of time, effort, expertise,\n      and funds continue to be made to produce, collect, quality\n      control, interpret, and archive ionosonde data. It is therefore\n      important that the data suppliers and Lowell GIRO Data Center\n      (LGDC) are appropriately acknowledged in scientific publications\n      that include analysis of data obtained from LGDC servers.\n\n      Please read Rules of the Road\n      https://giro.uml.edu/didbase/RulesOfTheRoad.html for license\n      information and refer to Acknowledgements List\n      https://giro.uml.edu/didbase/acknowledgements.htm to use GIRO\n      data per license requirements.",
