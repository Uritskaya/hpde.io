        "Description": "Terminated Folded Dipole and Dual Polarization Spectrograph system at the AJ4CO Radio Astronomy\n   Observatory in High Springs, Florida.\nThe TFD array consists of two 4-element (32 foot) square array. Each\nantenna element is 32 feet long. Polarization is simulataneous RCP\nand LCP. TFD array is aligned to true north. The Dual-Polarization Spectrograph\noperates at 16 -32 MHz simultaneous RCP and LCP providing 300 channels\nper polarization (600 total). It is a swept frequency reeiver\nselectable 7.5, 15, 30, 60 kHz pre-detection bandwidth, ~6.7\nsweeps/sec, integration time 500 microseconds per sample. The\nfrequency resolution is 53 kHz, delta-T is 150 milliseconds.\n   \n   See the Information URL for a link to a document providing\n   additional descriptions of the instrument characteristics.",
