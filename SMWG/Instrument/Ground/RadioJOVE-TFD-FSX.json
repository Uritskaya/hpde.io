        "Description": "RadioJOVE Terminated Folded Dipole (TFD) and FSX series\n   spectrograph systems\n   \nThe terminated folded dipole (TFD) array with 24 foot (7.3\nm) elements is designed for a wide bandwidth, from 15 to 30+ MHz, for\nHF band radio astronomy. This array has proven very useful for\nobserving emission from Jupiter, the Sun, and other phenomena present\nin the upper half of the HF band. There are two versions of the TFD -\n a 4 element (24 foot each) and an 8 element (30 foot each) variant. AJ4CO has the only\noperational 8 element TFD. Both the 4 and 8 element versions are dual\npolarization phased array antennas covering 15 to 30+ MHz. Dave\nTypinski is the technical contact for the TFD array.\n\nThe FSX series of spectrographs are more or less functionally\nsimilar. The main difference is that if there is an \"S\" at the end\n(like FSX-8S) these are polarization switching units while the FSX instruments are\nsingle polarization instruments, all models operate from 15 to 30 MHz. \n\nThe FS200B single polarization spectrographs were developmental\ninstruments used at the University of Florida Radio Observatory (UFRO)\nand Windward Community College Radio Observatory (WCCRO).  After the\ndemise of UFRO that instrument was moved to the AJ4CO facility. It\ncovers the same frequency range (15-30 MHz) but uses different\ncircuitry. Richard S. Flagg is the technical contact for the FSX\nseries of spectrographs.\n   ",
