        "Description": "Research in Heliophysics requires information from multiple sources which includes data from\nand about spacecrafts, groundbased observatories, models, simulations and more. The\nresults from research are also invaluable in building up a body of knowledge and need to be\navailable. All the different sources and types of information are considered a \"Resource\". The\nResources exist, are shared, exchanged and used in a framework called the \"data\nenvironment\". The SPASE (Space Physics Archive Search and Extract) group has defined a\nData Model which is a set of terms and values along with the relationships between them that\nallow describing all the resources in a heliophysics data environment. It is the result of many\nyears of effort by an international collaboration of heliophysicists and information scientists to\nunify and improve on existing Space and Solar Physics data models. The intent of this Data\nModel is to provide the means to describe resources, most importantly scientifically useful\ndata products, in a uniform way so they may be easily registered, found, accessed, and used.\n\nThe Data Model provides enough detail to allow a scientist to understand the content of Data\nProducts (e.g., a set of files for 3 second resolution Geotail magnetic field data for1992 to\n2005), together with essential retrieval and contact information. It also allows for the\nincremental annotation of resources with expert assessments and the free association of\nresources to create bundles or networks of resources. Resource descriptions can be stored\nwith the data or at remote locations. Sites can harvest the resource descriptions to enable\nservices like a search engine or portal (Virtual Observatory). A typical use would be to have a\ncollection of descriptions stored in one or more related internet-based registries of products;\nthat can be queried with specifically designed search engines and ultimately link users to the\ndata they need. The Data Model also provides constructs for describing components of such\na data delivery system. This includes repositories, registries and services.",
