        "Description": "The SOHO LASCO CME catalog contains all CMEs manually identified since 1996 from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. LASCO has three telescopes C1, C2, and C3. However, only C2 and C3 data are used for uniformity in identifying CMEs because C1 was disabled in June 1998. Note that the list is necessarily incomplete because of the nature of identification. In the absence of a perfect automatic CME detector program, manual identification is still the best way to identify CMEs. This data base are serving as a reference to validate automatic identification programs being developed. ",
        "Acknowledgement": "This CME catalog is generated and maintained at the CDAW Data Center by NASA and The Catholic University of America in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory. SOHO is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA.",
