        "Description": "This is a catalog of type II bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave (WAVES) experiment on board the Wind spacecraft and the associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. The type II burst catalog is derived from the Wind/WAVES catalog available at http://lep694.gsfc.nasa.gov/waves/waves.html by adding a few missing events. The CMEs in this catalog are called radio-loud CMEs because of their ability to produce type II radio bursts. The CME sources are also listed, as derived from the Solar Geophysical Data listing or from inner coronal images such as Yohkoh/SXT and SOHO/EIT. Some solar sources have also been obtained from Solarsoft Latest Events Archive after October 1, 2002: http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest_events_archive.html",
